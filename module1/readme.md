# Module 1

Welcome to Metana Camp. The goal here is to build day by day and become 1% better than I was the day before. The goal is to become a software engineer in the space of web3 through demonstration of modules and growth.  

The goal of module 1 is to learn javascript (js) basics, react basics, and build a todo app.
